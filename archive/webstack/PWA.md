# Progressive Web App

[Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps) is web application that work like desktop application (fast, installable, with offline capabilities) based on [offline first](https://offlinefirst.org/) design 

* PWA is a bundle of technologies
  * [Web app Manifests](#Application-Manifest) make web applications installable
  * [Service workers](#Service-Workers) proxy requests between web applications and network
  * [Cache API](#Cache-static-data-with-Cache-API) 
    is used to provide a cache of HTTP requests/responses of static data
  * [IndexedDB](#Cache-dynamic-data-with-IndexedDB) 
    is used to provide a cache of dynamic data; e.g. from REST APIs
  * [Background Sync](#Background-Sync) defer tasks to be run in a service worker until
    the user has a stable network connection 
    (e.g. sending saved POST requests saved temporary in IndexedDB)
  * [Web Push Notifications](#Web-Push-Notifications) allow web applications to notify messages to user/device to go back to the web page with new content
  * [Responsive Design](CSS.md) makes web applications look like native apps
  * [Media Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API)

## Application Manifest

[Web app Manifests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)
make web applications installable like native application on a homescreen of a device
* **prerequisite**: require a running service worker
* links
  * [Web App Manifest Explanation by Google](https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest)
  * [How to provide your own in-app install experience](https://web.dev/articles/customize-install) 
    to make web application installable
  * [Can I use: Add to home screen](https://caniuse.com/web-app-manifest) 
* major manifest properties:
  * [name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/name): 
    long name of the web application
  * [short_name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/short_name): 
    short name of the web application; e.g. displayed on phone home screen
  * [start_url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/start_url): 
    start URL of the web application (could be overwridden)
  * [scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/scope):
    restricts which web pages are displayed inside PWA context. 
    If the user navigates outside the scope, it reverts to a normal web page inside a browser 
    tab or window
  * [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/display):
    specify how much of browser UI is shown to the user; e.g. use `standalone` to make web app 
    like native application
  * [background_color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/background_color):
    background color while loading and a splashscreen
  * [theme_color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/theme_color):
    define theme color used for several ui elements
  * [orientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/orientation):
    defines the default screen orientation
    * tip: it's better to support both portrait /landscape orientation instead of restrict users
  * [icons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/icons):
    defines icons that can be used for different context; e.g. on homescreen
  * [related_applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/related_applications):
    native applications that user can install as alternative to web application

### App Manifest alternative for Safari

Safari does not yet App Manifest but meta tags can be used as alternatives.

* links
  * [Safari supported Meta Tags](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html)
  * [Donâ€™t use iOS meta tags irresponsibly in your Progressive Web Apps](https://firt.dev/ios-meta/)
* major meta tags:
  * `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">`: 
    enable web application as mobile web application
  * `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black">`: 
    somewhat equivalent to 
    [theme_color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/theme_color)
  * `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Applicatin name">`: 
    equivalent to 
    [short_name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/short_name)
  * `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="..." size="..x..">`: 
    define the used icon for homescreen like 
    [icons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/icons)

## Service Workers

[Service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker) 
proxy requests between web applications and network (e.g. for caching).

* links
  * [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers)
  * [Service Workers: an Introduction](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/service-worker-overview/)
  * [Are Service Workers Ready? - Check Browser Support](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)
* concepts
  * JavaScript's application run in a single thread
  * [Web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) 
    are executed in another thread; in background. 
    They perform tasks without interfering with the user interface
  * [Service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) 
    are a special types of Web workers
  * Service workers only work with https (and localhost as exception)
  * Service workers support only http requests made with
    [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
    [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) is not supported
* install lifecycle
  * frontend javascript (in window context) 
    [register a service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers#registering_your_worker)
  * browser will **install** the service worker asynchronously and sent a `install` event to installed service worker on completion
    * install of a service worker happens not with every registration, 
      but the first time or if the code of service worker changes (`sw.js`)
  * browser decide when the installed/updated service worker is **activated**
    * default: if existing version is running, user has to close tab and then the new version is activated
    * when a service worker is activated a `activate` event to the service worker is sent
  * it means that with default behaviours, user has to close/reload the application several times 
    to have a new version of service worker working on the application
* service workers re-acts on dedicated events
  * [install](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/install_event#examples) event;
    e.g. to download static assets in caches
  * [activate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/activate_event#examples) event;
    e.g. cleanup old versions of caches
  * [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/fetch_event)
    events from requests made with [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API);
    e.g. access/update caches depending on cache strategies
  * `sync` events made by [Background Synchronization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API)
  * `push` events made by push notifications
* tips  
  * Offline can be simulated in Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers >
    select "Offline"
  * use [self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/self) 
    in service worker code to access the global scope 
    ([self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/self) exists also for Window)
  * [ServiceWorkerRegistration.update()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/update) 
    attemps to update new version of a service worker
    * update() could be triggered regularly with 
      [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) every minute
  * use of [skipWaiting()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/skipWaiting#example) and [Clients.claim()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients/claim#example)
    allow to use an activated service worker on clients (tabs) without having to reload the page
    * changing default behaviour can produce subtle bugs; e.g. if pending save operation is waiting for available network or if there is breaking changes in APIs
  * call [importScripts()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts)
    to imports external js file in service workers (e.g. 3rd-party library like 
    [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb#readme))

## Cache static data with Cache API

[Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) 
is used to provide a cache of HTTP requests/responses of **static data** (e.g. application assets) with GET HTTP requests
* links
  * [Got any Cache? Basic Service Worker Caching](https://www.afasterweb.com/2016/12/31/got-any-cache-basic-service-worker-caching/) and [Upgrading Your Service Worker Cache](https://www.afasterweb.com/2017/01/31/upgrading-your-service-worker-cache/) (tutorial)
  * [Cache and return requests](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/service-worker-overview/#cache_and_return_requests) (tutorial)
  * [The offline cookbook](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/) (caching strategies; great reference)

  * [Service worker and caching from other origins](https://filipbech.github.io/2017/02/service-worker-and-caching-from-other-origins)
  * [MDN ServiceWorker Cookbook](https://github.com/mdn/serviceworker-cookbook) (examples)
  * [Service Worker Recipes](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/service-worker) (examples)
* concepts
  * caches are generally created to store application assets and provide offline mode
  * Cache API is available for frontend javascript and service workers
  * Cache API is not designed to requests/responses of REST API because caches is based on the URL only
    (cache cannot be based on request parameters, like a transaction-id, or request payload)
    * see [Caching Dynamic data](#cache-dynamic-data-with-indexeddb) for caches of REST API
  * Cache API differs from
    [HTTP Caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching)  
    by providing a way to service workers and frontend javascript to implements caching strategies
    * caches of a web-application for a given scope can be shared between 
      frontend javascript and service workers
  * api: [caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/caches) 
    global read-only property returns 
    [CacheStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage); 
    an interface to manage [Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache)
* *pre-caching* is used to cache assets ahead of time during; e.g. 
  [install event of service worker](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#on-install---as-a-dependency) 
* *cache versioning* require versioned cache name and 
  *clean-up* of old versions typically during
  [activate event of service worker](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#on-activate)
* *runtime/dynamic caching* or cache assets on demand during
  * [user interactions](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#on-user-interaction)
    (from frontend javascript event-listener)
  * [fetch event of service worker](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#on-network-response)
* [generic fallback](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#generic-fallback) to returns an offline version of the asset (e.g. offline.html)
* major caching strategies
  * [cache only](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#cache-only)
    strategy to be used for static data
  * [network only](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#network-only) 
    strategy to be used for non-offline request (e.g. REST API)
  * [cache, falling back to network](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network) 
    strategy to be used to mix *cache only* for static data (in the cache) and *network only* (not present in the cache)
  * [cache then network](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#cache-then-network) 
    strategy to be used for resources updating frequently (e.g. articles)
    * "something is provided quickly to user and cache is updated aftwerwards"
    * cache API used from frontend javascript & service workers
  * etc. (see [The offline cookbook](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/))
* [different caching strategies](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/#putting-it-together) 
  can be mixed together 
  * choosen strategy can depend on request URL or content type

## Cache dynamic data with IndexedDB

[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) 
is a transactional Key-Value database in the browser and is used to store dynamic data
(e.g. response of GET requests of REST APIs) 
* links
  * [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB) and 
    [IndexedDB key characteristics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Basic_Terminology)
  * see [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb#readme), [idb-keyval](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval), [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/) libraries to simplify the quite complex IndexedDB API
  * [Best Practices for Using IndexedDB](https://web.dev/articles/indexeddb-best-practices)
* concepts
  * [Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) vs 
    [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API):
    * Cache API caches HTTP requests / responses
      * Cache API cannot cache dynamic data from REST APIs because it does not know the sequences of 
      the calls and does know not what to do in error cases
    * IndexedDB caches Key-Value pairs under control of the web application
      * (e.g. version of data can be part of the key, transformed json can be stored as value)  
  * [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) vs 
    [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage):
    * IndexedDB can be accessed from normal JS and Service Workers; localStorage is available only in normal JS
    * IndexedDB can store much more data as localStorage
  * [caching strategies](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook) 
    can also be used with [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) to cache GET REST APIs request
  * [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) in conjunction with Background sync allow to support offline capabilities with "update" REST APIs requests
  * **take care**: caching dynamic data is complex and produce subtle bugs; see [Best Practices for Using IndexedDB](https://web.dev/articles/indexeddb-best-practices)

## Background Sync

[Background Synchronization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API) 
can be used to defer tasks to be run in a service worker until the user has a stable network 
connection (e.g. sending saved POST requests saved temporary in IndexedDB).

[Web Periodic Background Synchronization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Periodic_Background_Synchronization_API)
allows web applications to make any fetches/updates, at a periodic time interval.

## PWA with Angular

* [Service Workers](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro)
  * see [Create a Progressive Web App with the Angular CLI](https://web.dev/articles/creating-pwa-with-angular-cli) and [Precaching with the Angular service worker](https://web.dev/articles/precaching-with-the-angular-service-worker):
    * Configure Service Workers in an Angular project: `ng add @angular/pwa`
    * Angular/PWA generate a service worker based on the `ngsw-config.json`
    * we can specify in `ngsw-config.json`
      * which files or urls should be prefetched by the generated service worker
      * caches to be used for rest APIs
      * service-worker can be configured to fetch data from the network and use cache data in case of timeout; see [strategy of cacheconfig](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-config#strategy)
    * to disable quick service worker on production; set `serviceWorker` to false in `angular-cli.json` and serve a new version of the application in production (user still have to load the application twice)
  * use [SwUpdate](https://angular.io/api/service-worker/SwUpdate#swupdate) service to [detect and install new version of the application](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-communications#swupdate-service)
* [Application Shell](https://angular.io/guide/app-shell) to display an initial static page while the application is loaded
  * Angular application is pre-rendered with [Angular Universal](https://angular.io/guide/universal) under the hood but without having a running Angular Universal server.
* [Push Notifications](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-notifications) with 
  [SwPush](https://angular.io/api/service-worker/SwPush#usage-notes) service
